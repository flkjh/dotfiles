# MY xresources file used for urxvt
My .Xresources is currently under development.
I like to tweak colors, so I have started to tinker with 256 colors for urxvt, and using these colors to tweak my programming environment for vim scripts, bash, python, go, c, c++, java.

## REMARK
I am a pleb that likes to tinker with ricing and color schemes and spending the majority of my time in urxvt and vim, so I am likely to change my dotfiles for colors a lot, so version numbers will be a key element for the looks of it all.

## TODO's 
Create more custom 256 colors that I feel is missing in the original 256 colors.
Create custom key bindings for urxvt once I get the hang of it.
