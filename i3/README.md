# i3
My custom i3 config

## Remarks
Changed horizontal split to super+g since I want to use the keys h, j, k, l for moving horizontally, vertically.
Splitting vertically is bound to super+b.

I use the keys y, u, i, o for workspaces.
Examples:
super+y+y opens workspace yy.
super+y+u opens workspace yu.
super+i+o opens workspace io.
super+shift+i+i moves focused window to workspace ii.
