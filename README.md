# dotfiles
Dotfiles for Linux...

My dotfiles are constantly changing so file version numbers will be important and the files in the dev branch can change rapidly when I tinker with stuff...

## Remark
I am just a pleb spending more and more time with ricing and programming.

Feel free to use any of the available files, but keep in mind that they are written by a pleb like me, and that there are no guarantees that things will work.
