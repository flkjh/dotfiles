# dotfiles
Dotfiles for Linux...

## Checkout dev branch for more updated files

Go to branch dev if you want to see more files and more up to date versions.

I am careful to update shit if I don't feel that the files are solid enough for public distribution. For example, I write vim scripts and bash functions that I use a lot, but I am still careful to publish too much in the branch main. So I feel comfortable enough to publish shit in dev branch.

## Remark
I am just a pleb spending more and more time with ricing and programming.

My dotfiles are constantly changing so file version numbers will be important and the files in the dev branch can change rapidly when I tinker with stuff...

Feel free to use any of the available files, but keep in mind that they are written by a pleb like me, and that there are no guarantees that things will work.
