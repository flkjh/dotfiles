# dotfiles dev branch
Dot files for Linux under development.

All dot files in the dev branch are for tinkering and should safely be considered underdeveloped.

## Remark
I am just a pleb spending more and more time with ricing and programming.

Feel free to use any of the available files, but keep in mind that they are written or modified by a pleb like me, and that there are no guarantees that things will work.
