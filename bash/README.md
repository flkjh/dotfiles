# bash 
The bash config uses a lot of aliases and functions for convenience.

I am gradually extending, rewriting and refactoring it. Some functions can surely be rewritten as aliases.

I am at no means a bash expert but I like to tinker with bash to make my life easier.

## dev branch
All dotfiles in the dev branch are tinkered with and can change rapidly.
